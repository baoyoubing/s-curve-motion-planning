# S-curve-motion-planning, scientific papers included.

At the release page, an archive is included how to create a s-curve.
This archive example code can be used to build motion blocks.
The functions ar c, c++ compatible. You can delete the opencascade graphics part from the code, it's just used
to check outputs.
- velocity up s-curve [acc period]
- velocity down s-curve [dcc period].
- acceleration begin value.
- acceleration end value.
- velocity begin.
- velocity end.
- max acceleration.
- lineair stage example.
